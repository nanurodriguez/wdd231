//Using localStorage to store the last visit date by the client, display one of three possible messages about the time between page visits in the content area.
//If this is the user's first visit, display "Welcome! Let us know if you have any questions.".
//If the amount of time between visits is less than a day, display "Back so soon! Awesome!".
//Otherwise, display the number of days in a message like this: "You last visited n days ago.", where n is the actual, whole number of days between visits. If the number of days is 1, then change the language to "day" not "days".
